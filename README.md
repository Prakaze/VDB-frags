# VDB-frags
Additional frags for Fragmentarium.

# How to use
1. Clone the repository, or download it as a zip.
2. Add the `Include` file to the include path in Edit > Preferences... > Include Paths. You probably want to add the path after the default Include separated with a ';', not replace it.
3. You can now open the examples to see how to use the frags.
